NEEDS FIXING
=============
* When writing big paragraphs, suggestion window is shown in wrong locations.
* Selecting a single word selects the whole text. Tested only on OSX.
* When typing reaches end of page, there won't be enough room to show suggestions. So some part of the suggestion window will be hidden. If possible, detect this condition and show the suggestion window to the top of the word.
* clicking on top of a word shows the popup
* Handle errors
* When typing fast and we have no suggestions fetched so far from server, user pressing SPACE bar will see the english text inserted. We need to mimic google's transliterate here so that pressing space in the above condition, transliterates the text. For this, when pressing space, we need to detect this condition, record the {line, ch} values and replace that range when we have something available from server.


TO IMPLEMENT (in no order)
==============
* Hooking reverse transliterate and transliterate while typing
* Hooking language detection API call
* Add a save functionality
* Add export to PDF
* Add necessary help text about markdown syntax
