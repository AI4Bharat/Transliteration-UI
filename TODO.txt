NEEDS FIXING
=============
* When putting a word brake character, we need to insert the selected text. Eg after typing press ".".
* When typing, page title changes which makes the whole page looks like flickering. This needs fixing.
* Ctrl + Space & clicking on top of a word shows the popup
* Handle errors
* Make sure popup will have the latest word always. Sometime some suggestions are missing when typing fast
* Report connectivity problems and slow internet connections on top of the browser like stackoverflow messages
* When typing fast and we have no suggestions fetched so far from server, user pressing SPACE bar will see the english text inserted. We need to mimic google's transliterate here so that pressing space in the above condition, transliterates the text. For this, when pressing space, we need to detect this condition, record the {line, ch} values and replace that range when we have something available from server. 


TO IMPLEMENT (in no order)
==============
* Hooking reverse transliterate and transliterate while typing
* Persist the preview preference based on cookies.
* Hooking language detection API call
* Add a save functionality
* Add export to PDF
* Add necessary help text about markdown syntax
